# Self-Learning Advanced English Repository
### Welcome to my self-learning advanced English repository! 
This repository serves as a personal learning log and contains resources I use for independent studying of advanced English grammar.
## Content
### This repository is divided into two main sections:
- Advanced Grammar in Use: This folder is broken down into multiple Units. Each Unit folder includes:
  - A PDF file of each unit as transcribed by me from R. Murphy's "Advanced Grammar in Use" textbook.
  - Images of the textbook pages with my annotations.
  - Images of the textbook exercise pages with my solutions, annotations, and verifications.
- Write&Improve: This folder houses PDF files of my English compositions.
  - The files include corrections, error analysis, and proofreading. I source the essay topics from the Write&Improve website by Cambridge English. (https://writeandimprove.com/)
## Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to track my progress and consolidate all crucial learning materials in one place.
## Usage
You are welcome to use this repository to:
- Gain insights into self-learning methodologies and strategies.
- Access high-quality learning materials and resources.
- Understand common mistakes and corrections in English compositions.
- Gain a peek into the structure and content of R. Murphy's "Advanced Grammar in Use".

**!Please keep in mind that this is a self-learning journey, and while I strive for accuracy, there might be mistakes. Therefore, treat my notes and exercises as a supplement to your study, not a sole source of truth!**
## Interaction
I am open to discussions, collaborations, and feedback! If you spot an error, or if you have any suggestions, or simply want to share your thoughts on learning English, feel free to reach out. Your input can help me and others improve our learning process.
