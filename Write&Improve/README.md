# Write & Improve
## Welcome to the "Write & Improve" section of my repository!

In this directory, you'll find PDF files containing:

- **Original Essays:** My own written works on various topics, inspired by prompts from the Write & Improve website by Cambridge English.
- **Graded Essays:** The same essays after being assessed and corrected.
- **Error Corrections:** Documents where I analyze and correct the mistakes identified in the graded essays.
The goal of this folder is to track my progress in English writing skills and to provide a space for self-reflection and error correction.

**!Please be aware that this is a part of my self-learning journey and there might be occasional errors or misconceptions in my work!**

Feel free to utilize these resources for your own study or teaching purposes! If you have any comments, suggestions, or you spot any errors, don't hesitate to reach out. Your input is highly valued!
