# Advanced Grammar in Use
## Welcome to the "Advanced Grammar in Use" section of my repository!
This directory is structured into Units based on R. Murphy's "Advanced Grammar in Use" textbook. Each Unit contains:
- **PDF Transcription:** A PDF file with my transcription of each unit from the textbook.
- **Annotated Textbook Pages:** Images of the textbook pages supplemented with my personal annotations.
- **Exercise Pages with Solutions:** Images of the textbook exercise pages featuring my solutions, annotations, and checkmarks.

The purpose of this folder is to provide a reference point for my self-study progress in advanced English grammar, as well as to share valuable learning materials and insights.

**!Please note that all notes and solutions are my personal work and interpretations as part of my self-study, so there may be some inaccuracies!**

 Feel free to use these resources for your own learning, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or corrections!
